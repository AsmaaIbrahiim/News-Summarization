The whole world is now fighting Covid-19. There are more than one hundred million detected cases across the globe since the beginning of the crisis. [1] According to the world health organization (WHO) [2], it is essential for individuals to wear face masks upon interacting with others. With the aid of visual systems, it can be detected whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This will help researchers to incorporate the factor of wearing masks in their research projects about Covid-. In addition, it will help authorities to monitor individuals and take action upon bare face detection. The general problem is an object detection problem [3] which is detecting people with and without masks in offline or live videos. In this project, we tackle part of the problem; We tackle the image classification part [4]. Given an image with one person as input, the problem is to classify the image whether it is an image of a masked person or non-masked person. In this project, we are using two popular datasets for face masks detection. The first dataset is the Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD) [5]. This dataset consists of 5000 masked faces and 90,000 unmasked faces collected from the public domain. However the great number of images available in RMDF, it seems extremely unbalanced and needs reasonable preprocessing in order to have an unbiased model. Through manual investigation for the dataset, there is no guarantee on the diversity of ethnicity of the people in its images; however, this problem may not be effective in our approach as the network would learn specific location or shape of the mask itself not the faces. The mask shape and color diversities are guaranteed through our manual investigation. For testing the generalization of the model, images from the medical-mask dataset are used [6].
